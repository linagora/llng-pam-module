# Runs the sshd anchor unit tests (tests/test_sshd_anchor.c).
#
# The assertions live in C, next to the other unit tests, and ctest runs them
# directly. This wrapper exists because tests/mutation/catalogue names its
# suites as shell scripts: the mutation runner rebuilds the tree after applying
# a C mutant and then executes `bash <suite>`, so the entry for the anchor walk
# needs one.
#
# It fails rather than skips when the binary is missing: a skip would let the
# mutation runner conclude the control is covered when nothing ran at all.
