# test_ob_client_jwt.sh
#
# Guards the client_secret_jwt assertion helper (issue #256).
#
# ob-enroll authenticates to the OIDC token endpoint with a client_secret_jwt
# assertion. It used to build it in shell, ending in
#
#     openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$client_secret" -binary
#
# and openssl has no form that takes the HMAC key anywhere but argv.
# /proc/<pid>/cmdline is world-readable, so the host's OIDC client secret was
# readable by any local user -- once per poll of the device-grant loop, of the
# order of sixty times over five minutes, while an operator is away in a
# browser approving the grant.
#
# Two things are asserted here, and the second is the one that matters:
#
#   1. the assertion is correct -- claims per RFC 7523, and a signature an
#      independent implementation agrees with;
#   2. the secret is not observable from outside the process. That is checked
#      by reading /proc/<pid>/cmdline of the running helper, not by reading the
#      source, because "we pass it on stdin now" is exactly the kind of claim
#      that survives a refactor in prose while stopping being true in fact.

# that shells out to `openssl dgst -hmac "$secret"` leaks from a *child*, and
# the helper's own cmdline stays clean. That is precisely the code this change
# removed, so it is precisely the shape a regression would take.
#
# (An interface change -- teaching the helper to take --secret -- is caught by
# the refusals test below instead, since it means accepting an option that does
# not exist. It cannot be caught here: the shipped invocation only ever feeds
# stdin, so no mutation of the helper alone puts the marker on this cmdline.)
