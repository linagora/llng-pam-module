# Competitors and Alternatives

This document compares LLNG-PAM-MODULE with alternative solutions for
SSH authentication, authorization, and session management.

## Solution Categories

There are two distinct meanings of "PAM" in the security industry:

- **PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)**: Linux authentication framework
- **PAM (Privileged Access Management)**: Enterprise security product category

LLNG-PAM-MODULE addresses both: it's a Linux PAM module that, combined with
LemonLDAP::NG's bastion feature, provides Privileged Access Management capabilities.

## Direct Competitors: PAM Modules for SSO

These are alternative PAM modules for centralizing SSH authentication:

| Solution | Protocol | Features | Limitations |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **pam_sss (SSSD)** | LDAP, Kerberos | Widely deployed, FreeIPA integration | No web SSO, complex setup |
| **pam_krb5** | Kerberos | Strong enterprise auth | Requires Kerberos infrastructure |
| **pam_ldap** | LDAP | Simple, direct LDAP auth | No SSO, no MFA integration |
| **pam_cas** | CAS | Apereo CAS integration | Limited to CAS protocol |
| **pam_oauth2** | OAuth2 | Modern protocol | Community-maintained, limited features |

### LLNG-PAM-MODULE Advantages

- Unified web SSO and system authentication
- Built-in MFA support via LemonLDAP::NG
- Server groups for granular access control
- Token-based authentication (no password exposure)
- Session recording via bastion mode

| **Native RDP client** | Works with mstsc.exe and other RDP clients |
| **Session recording** | `.wrm` format, convertible to MP4 |
| **Unified authorization** | Same `pamAccessServerGroups` as SSH |
| **Authentication hook** | Python-based integration with LLNG API |

### Comparison with Commercial Solutions

| Feature | LLNG + Redemption | Wallix Bastion | CyberArk |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| RDP proxy | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Session recording | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Web SSO integration | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Open source | ✅ (GPL-2.0) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cost | Free | €€€ | €€€€ |

### Limitations

- **License**: Redemption is GPL-2.0 (modifications must be published)
- **Password vault**: Not included (pass-through mode for credentials)
- **NLA support**: Works but requires careful configuration

## Migration Paths

### From pam_ldap or pam_krb5

1. Deploy LemonLDAP::NG with your existing LDAP/AD backend
2. Install LLNG-PAM-MODULE alongside existing PAM config
3. Test with a pilot group using LLNG tokens
4. Gradually migrate users to LLNG authentication
5. Remove legacy PAM modules

### From Commercial PAM Solutions

1. Assess current session recording requirements
2. Deploy LLNG bastion for SSH access
3. Migrate SSH servers first (LLNG strength)
4. Keep commercial solution for RDP if needed
5. Evaluate cost savings after migration

## Summary

LLNG-PAM-MODULE with LemonLDAP::NG provides a unique combination:

- **Cost**: Free and open source vs €50-100/user/year for commercial PAM
- **Scope**: Web SSO + SSH + bastion in one solution
- **Flexibility**: Fully customizable policies and integrations
- **Compliance**: Session recording for audit requirements

For organizations primarily using Linux/SSH infrastructure and needing web SSO,
LemonLDAP::NG offers the most comprehensive and cost-effective solution.
